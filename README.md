Crypto Pandas is a lightweight Python library that fuses the power of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) with the market-connectivity of [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/).
In a single line, it transforms CCXTâ€™s raw JSON into a clean, typed DataFrame, ready for analysis, back-testing, or real-time dashboards.
The same DataFrame-centric API also lets you create, edit, and cancel live exchange orders directly from pandas DataFrames.

## Features

- Transformation of outputs to pandas DataFrame when applicable.
- Setting proper data types.
- Transformation of DataFrame of orders to ensure proper format for exchange:
  - Determining volume based on notional amount if user prefers providing notional
  - Rounding and capping of price and volume based on exchange's symbol parameters.

## Installation

Crypto Pandas can be installed on Python 3.11~3.13:

```bash
pip install crypto-pandas
```

## Getting Started

Crypt -Pandas works near identically to CCXT. Just add `exchange = CCXTPandasExchange(exchange=exchange)`
and the exchange methods provided by CCXT will be exposed to Crypto Pandas.
More examples can be found on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sigma-quantiphi/crypto-pandas/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fexamples): 

```python
import ccxt
from crypto_pandas import CCXTPandasExchange

# Initialize a CCXTPandasExchange object
exchange = ccxt.binance(dict(apiKey="your_api_key_here", secret="your_secret_here"))
exchange = CCXTPandasExchange(exchange=exchange)

# Fetch open orders from an exchange
open_orders = exchange.fetch_open_orders(symbol="BTC/USDT")

# Halve the amount and edit orders
open_orders["amount"] /= 2
response = exchange.edit_orders(open_orders)

# Display the transformed orders dataframe
print(response)
```
