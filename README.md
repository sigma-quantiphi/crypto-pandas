Crypto Pandas is a Python library that simplifies the process of interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges via the CCXT
library. It focuses on streamlining the process of fetching and cleaning exchange-related data, as well as transforming
dataframes of orders to send to the exchange.

## Features

- Simplified integration with the CCXT library.
- Utilities for cleaning and preparing exchange data.
- Easy transformation of order dataframes for compatibility with cryptocurrency exchanges.

## Installation

To install Crypto Pandas, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install crypto-pandas
```

Make sure you have Python 3.12+ installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

If any dependencies are missing, they will be installed automatically.

## Getting Started

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use Crypto Pandas to fetch and clean data using CCXT.

### Basic Usage

Crypto-Pandas works near identically to CCXT. Just add `exchange = CCXTPandasExchange(exchange=exchange)`
and the exchange methods provided by CCXT will be exposed to Crypto-Pandas.

```python
import ccxt
from crypto_pandas import CCXTPandasExchange

# Initialize a CCXTPandasExchange object
exchange = ccxt.binance(dict(apiKey="your_api_key_here", secret="your_secret_here"))
exchange = CCXTPandasExchange(exchange=exchange)

# Fetch open orders from an exchange
open_orders = exchange.fetch_open_orders(symbol="BTC/USDT")

# Halve the amount and edit orders
open_orders["amount"] /= 2
response = exchange.edit_orders(open_orders)

# Display the transformed orders dataframe
print(response)
```
